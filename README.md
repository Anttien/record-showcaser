The idea of this school project was to create a RESTful single-page application that music producers could use to showcase their music. The application allows users to upload their music to the server, where the tracks are stored and modified to shortened showcase versions that are then presented in the application. Since the original tracks are stored in the server, there is a possibility to extend the service to support selling the tracks. Only mp3 format is currently supported.
