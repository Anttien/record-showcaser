# Levykauppa / Music store

The idea of this school project was to create a simple music store as a RESTful single-page application, where producers could showcase their music. It doesnâ€™t support selling or buying music. The application allows users to upload their music to the server, where the tracks are stored and modified to shortened showcase versions that are then presented in the application. Only mp3 format is currently supported.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP, MariaDB

An Apache server was used to test the application.
